# RTS-Project
An experiment on how far I can take a project with the RTS theme.

Inspired by games like:
- [Rimworld](https://store.steampowered.com/app/294100/RimWorld/)
- [Dwarf Fortress](https://store.steampowered.com/app/975370/Dwarf_Fortress/)
- [Oxygen Not Included](https://store.steampowered.com/app/457140/Oxygen_Not_Included/)
- [Satisfactory](https://store.steampowered.com/app/526870/Satisfactory/)
